Codeforces API Wrapper in Scala

A Scala idiomatic? wrapper for the [Codeforces API](http://codeforces.com/api/help/)

## Features
The API is stronly-typed, no need to use JSON at all./
The whole API is implemented, but not througly tested, use at your own discretion.

## TODO
The authentication is missing, right now I dont't find it so useful since I'm just using this to ease scrapping.
